- 👋 Hi, I’m @ NeurotreeAppletreeIFneuron
- 👀 I’m interested in Neuroscience and Physiology, though these two subjects damn me hard. (3.16/4.0) fuck and bullshit your mother and I should be more hard-working and discipline.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning fifth-year undergraduate courses interested in human genomics, developmental and genetic models in brain at the circuit level, cell model and rodent model.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on hands-on biological experiment to have funs in observing cell dynamics under the microscope, and rodent model to see how their brain is being modulated and mapped and electrical circuits which may model these circuits.

- 📫 How to reach me: yixin.hou@mail.utoronto.ca and currently not interested in working with scholars educated in chhiina, thanks.
  
- ⚡ Fun fact: :) be kind to everyone but aware some bullsheet did not deserve it.
